Advancing Portable Documents for the Open Web Platform: EPUBWEB
===============================================================

This is the repo for a White Paper on EPUBWEB. For a high level overview, see the [presentation of Markus Gylling and Ivan Herman](http://www.w3.org/2014/Talks/1023-SF-IH/), given at the [Books in Browsers 2014 conference](http://booksinbrowsers.org), on the 23rd of October, 2014.

The [index.html](index.html) file is the latest “published” version of the White Paper; to view the document properly rendered in a browser, use the [”paged” version](http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/). The repository contains copies of previous “stable” versions, too. Finally, the current [development draft](draft/index.html) is also available for comments.

We welcome comments on the White Paper. You can either send us a mail (see below), raise an [issue on github](https://github.com/w3c/epubweb/issues) or send us a pull request. Thank you!

Markus Gylling (<mgylling@idpf.org>), Ivan Herman (<ivan@w3.org>).
